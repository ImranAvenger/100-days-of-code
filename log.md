# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 23, 2021 
##### First Day | Awesome experience 

**Today's Progress**: Learned C Structure, C Structure & Pointers || C Structure & Union ||

**Thoughts:** Comparitively every lessons of C Stucture & Union is hard than others topic of C programming. But I can cope up them. I need to focus in C memory allocation. Overall, I'm much better doing... And I have to learn C Structue and Function, C Unions.

### Day 2: July 24, 2021
##### Felt extra instancy to coding 

**Today's Progress**: Practicing examples of C Structure & Pointers, Learning C Structure & Function || C Structure & Union ||

**Thoughts:** I'm tired today to complete the practicing of the C Function examples. Next-day I have to do better practicing to complete the unit fully.
